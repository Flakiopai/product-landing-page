# ðŸ“¦ Project Reflection: Product Landing Page

## ðŸ§© What I Built

- Built a clean, responsive landing page using semantic HTML elements like `<section>`, `<header>`, and `<footer>`
- Implemented CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout, along with media queries for responsiveness
- Integrated user-friendly enhancements like smooth scrolling and a back-to-top button with JavaScript
- Included core sections: navigation, hero call-to-action, features, pricing table, contact form, and footer

## ðŸ“š What I Learned

- Structuring multi-section pages using semantic HTML
- Building responsive layouts using Flexbox, Grid, and `@media` queries
- Enhancing UX through vanilla JS for navigation and interactions
- Intro to accessibility practices: heading hierarchy, link clarity, and basic ARIA attributes

## ðŸš§ Challenges Faced

- Designing a pricing table that adapts gracefully across screen sizes
- Keeping CSS modular and maintainable
- Tuning scroll behavior and top button visibility
- Avoiding intrusive form validation while maintaining accessibility

## âœ¨ Highlights & Wins

- Page scales beautifully on mobile and desktop
- Navigation and scrolling feel polished and intuitive
- Strong visual balance between hero, feature sections, and footer
- Applied accessibility fundamentals (e.g. input labels, visible focus states)

## ðŸ”­ Future Improvements

- Add icons and illustrations for visual appeal
- Connect the contact form to a backend service (e.g. Formspree, Netlify)
- Expand accessibility with ARIA roles and live regions
- Introduce scroll-triggered animations with low motion impact

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

- Finalize and standardize `reflection.md` files across projects
- Build a centralized portfolio overview with links and previews
- Deploy this landing page via GitHub Pages
- Explore dynamic web apps powered by APIs and JavaScript frameworks
